# Speech Recognition System using NLP

## Project Overview
This project implements a Speech Recognition System using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system captures voice input through a microphone and converts spoken language into readable text.

This project demonstrates how machines can understand and process human speech using NLP-based speech recognition models.

---

## Objective
- To capture speech input using a microphone
- To convert spoken words into text
- To understand the working of speech recognition systems
- To apply NLP techniques for speech processing

---

## NLP Concepts Used
The following NLP-related concepts are used in this project:

- Speech Processing
- Language Modeling
- Audio-to-Text Conversion
- Error Handling for unclear speech and network issues

---

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- SpeechRecognition library
- PyAudio (for microphone access)

---

## How the System Works
1. The microphone captures the audio input.
2. PyAudio provides access to the microphone hardware.
3. The SpeechRecognition library processes the recorded audio.
4. The audio is sent to a speech recognition engine (Google API).
5. The spoken words are converted into text and displayed.

## How to Run the Project

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
