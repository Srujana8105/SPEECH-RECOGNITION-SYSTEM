# Speech Recognition System using NLP

## Overview
This project implements a Speech Recognition System in Python using Natural Language Processing techniques. It captures voice input from a microphone and converts spoken words into text.

## Objective
- Capture speech through a microphone
- Convert speech into readable text
- Understand the basics of speech recognition using NLP

## Tools Used
- Python
- SpeechRecognition library
- PyAudio
- Google Speech Recognition API

## How It Works
The system records audio using the microphone, processes it through the SpeechRecognition library, sends it to the recognition engine, and displays the converted text.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio


## Output

The complete working implementation and output of the project can be viewed in the Jupyter Notebook below:
